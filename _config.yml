    Hi there! Welcome to my personal blog :-). I'm a software engineer working on all sort of things.
    I enjoy not focusing on a particular area, i.e <i>only</i> backend, <i>only</i> frontend, etc. and rather
    try to learn about everything. Here you can find my last write-ups about whatever I'm
    working on. I eventually write some non-tech stuff as well. Enjoy the reading!
