Hi!

Well, just a bit about me. My name is Guillermo Carrasco, and I’m a computer scientist.
I’m currently working in Sweden as a Research Software Engineer. A bit of a strange situation, since
I'm working remotely for [Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/cancersciences/ics/facilities/wwcrc/).
Yes, this makes a Spanish guy working remotely from Sweden for a university in Scotland. That's me.

I’m passionate about new technologies, programming languages and every computer-related geeky stuff in general. I’m very interested in the field of [bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). It is incredible the opportunities that a computer scientist
has there to give free range to the imagination and creativity. A lot of things need to be done in the "bioinformatitian" world:
Enormous amounts of data to manage and analyze, huge HPCs to administrate, complex distributed systems, and a large etc.
I’m fortunate to be able to work in this field, as here I deal with real-world problems like those mentioned.

Now, why Mussol? Well… really, I don’t know. My friend [Roman Valls](http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/)
started calling me like that (it means owl in catalan), and I just kind of like it. It's also a symbol
of wisdom, quality that I've always admired, and lastly its a beautiful bird :).

Hope you enjoy reading!
