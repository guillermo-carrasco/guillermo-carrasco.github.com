Hi!

Well, just a bit about me. My name is Guillermo Carrasco, and I’m a computer scientist.
I’m currently working in Sweden as a Systems Developer in Science For Life Laboratory.

I’m passionate about new technologies, programming languages and every computer-related geeky stuff in general. Lately,
I’ve been very interested in the field of [bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). It is incredible the opportunities that a computer scientist
have there to give free rain to the imagination and creativity. A lot of things needs to be done in the “bioinformatitian” world:
Enormous amounts of data to manage and analyse, huge HPCs to administrate, complex parallel systems, and a large etc.
I’m very very lucky to work in Science For Life Laboratory, as there I deal with real-world problems like these.

Now, why Mussol? Well… really, I don’t know. My friend [Roman Valls](http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/)
started calling me like that (it means owl in catalan), and I just kind of like it.

Feel free to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/guillemch) or check my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermocarrasco) profile! (no, I’ll not share my facebook account).

Hope you enjoy reading!
