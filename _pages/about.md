# Professional

My name is Guillermo Carrasco, and I’m a computer scientist. I’m currently working in Sweden as a Research Software Engineer.
A bit of a strange situation, since I'm working remotely for
[Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/cancersciences/ics/facilities/wwcrc/).
Yes, this makes a Spanish guy working remotely from Sweden for a university in Scotland. That's me.

I’m passionate about new technologies, programming languages and every computer-related geeky stuff in general. I’m very interested in the field of [bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). It is incredible the opportunities that a computer scientist
has there to give free range to the imagination and creativity. A lot of things need to be done in the "bioinformatitian" world:
Enormous amounts of data to manage and analyze, huge HPCs to administrate, complex distributed systems, and a large etc.
I’m fortunate to be able to work in this field, its a never ending excitement!

# Personal
I consider myself to be an introverted, easy-going guy. I enjoy having time for my own, it is my way of "recharging".
however, I also **need** my friends around.

I have a lot of hobbies/passions, which I think its nice, since I'm hardly ever bored! Among them are: any
kind of sport, but climbing, alpinism or running are the ones that drive me crazy. Photography is another hobby
of mine :), check out my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guillemcat/) account to see my work. Finally,
classical guitar is what I'm spending most of my free time since I discovered its beauty just a couple of
months ago.

Now, why Mussol? Well… really, I don’t know. My friend [Roman Valls](http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/)
started calling me like that (it means owl in catalan), and I just kind of like it. It's also a symbol
of wisdom, quality that I've always admired, and lastly its a beautiful bird :).
