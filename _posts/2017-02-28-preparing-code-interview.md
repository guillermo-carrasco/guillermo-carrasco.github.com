This blog post is about how do _I_ prepare for technical interviews and some resources I find very useful.

Preparing for a technical interview is not really an easy or quick process. In some cases, doesn't
matter for how long have you been coding. You arrive to a technical interview and someone
asks you to implement on a whiteboard a variation of a [BFS][BFS] algorithm. You know what a BFS is,
and you know when and how to use it. In your day-to-day work you would most surely use an implementation
from a library of your choice. But writing it is a very different thing.

Even if I don't (totally) agree with these kind of interviews, its something that we as software
engineers have to deal with.

There are lots and really good posts out there on how to prepare for these interviews. Here are some
of the resources and strategies I follow, and that I want to share with you.

#### Resources

* [Cracking the Coding Interview, *by Gayle Laakmann McDowell*][ctci]: This book has just all you need. It
is well structured, has all the fundamentals you need to know explained in a clear way, and finally
**many** exercises to practice with their solutions. As a plus, it is not as expensive as usually these
kind of books are :smile:
* Trello: I created [this][trello] Trello board and recently made it public so that anyone can make use
of them. It is basically a summary of what you need to know. I also add two list "**In process**" and
"**Discarded**". These lists help me keep track of the processes I'm currently in.
* [Leetcode][Leetcode], [HackerRank][HackerRank] and [CareerCup][CareerCup] are very good sites in where
to practice your coding skills in this kind of problems.
* A whiteboard and a friend (or several) with patience: Its super important to practice these interview
as if you were doing an actual one. This means grabbing a techie friend and ask her to interview you.
Do that for real! No books, notes or laptop, **and a whiteboard**. May feel a bit awkward at the beginning,
but its worth it.

#### Strategy

As a general strategy, I do try to start preparing several weeks before the interview. That usually means
preparing *before* applying anywhere. The ideal would be months in advance, but I have never managed to
do that. This is how I do it:

1. First I brush up on all fundamentals (usually means re-reading Cracking The Coding Interview)
2. I start doing some problems in Leetcode or HackerRank
3. When I get a date for an interview, is when I start doing the mock interviews

This is a very rough overview of what I do. That is because this is just how _I_ do it and by no means
is the best way. It is just the one that works for me. Also, I always do some research on
the company I am applying for. This helps me understand their stack, the technologies they use, and has
proven to me to be a big help in first interviews.

I hope the list of resources above is useful for you, and hope the strategy I follow can guide the lost
ones as well :smile:.
