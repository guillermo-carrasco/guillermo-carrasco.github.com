Working remotely is becoming more and more common. From full time remote
positions, to part time or remote-friendly positions.

During my relatively short career, I have had the opportunity of experiencing
all different flavors of remote working. From my full time remote position at
[WWCRC](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/cancersciences/ics/facilities/wwcrc/)
to my current position at [iZettle](https://www.izettle.com), where remote work is normalized and
allows me to spend some days/weeks abroad without having to use my vacation days.

In this post, I want to share some practices that _I've found_ very useful to increase
my productivity when working remote. These tips also help remote workers to keep
feeling part of a team.

#### First things first: Does it work?

**YES**, remote work works. Many companies are still afraid that remote workers will
not perform. Some people is still skeptical when someone is working remotely.

In my experience, remote work not only works, but it helps _me_ to charge batteries
and disconnect from routine.

Of course, there are some things/practices that work better than others. So... what
can you and your team do to improve productivity and cooperativeness when part
of the team is working remotely?

##### What can I do?
If you have ever read any blog post or article about remote working, this will
sound familiar. Here are some of the things I do to feel comfortable and more
productive when working remotely:

1. **Follow a schedule**: Try to follow the same schedule that you would follow in your
work place. It is very easy to just keep working when you're working from home.
It is also easy to grab your laptop on a weekend and do some work if you're working
abroad, with no office that is empty on a Saturday evening. _If you would not do
this normally_, don't do it when working remotely.

2. **Set up a proper working place**: It is okay to lay on the couch for a while,
move around the house or go to a coffee place. However, try to have
a well prepared, comfortable place where you work most of the time. This will just
help you focus and make your body comfortable. This does not exclude of course
good an _necessary_ practices like taking :coffee: breaks, going for walks, etc.

3. **Be communicative**: I find this _extremely_ important. It is tremendously
easy to focus on your own work and ignore what others are doing when you are
not in your office. This is, in my humble opinion, a big mistake. In my experience,
this leads in the end to a feeling of loneliness and exclusion, since you end up
not taking part of discussions, and thus _decisions_, about what you are at the end working on.
There are tons of tools to help you communicate with your team when you're away.
Use them! [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Appear.in](https://appear.in/) or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) are some examples.

##### What can we (as a team) do?
There are some easy but important tips that will help the team keep up when people
is working remote.

1. **Be communicative**: Overlapping with point 3 above, being
communicative is important for everyone. As a team, involve your remote colleges
in discussions and meetings. Talk to them! If someone would join a discussion in the office, they
should join it when working remotely.

  As a remote employee, a small thing that I find really nice is to greet everyone when starting
  and finishing your work day. Informing about long breaks (lunch, walk, run...)
  also helps the team know you won't be responsive for a while.

2. **Be proactive**: Be proactive when it comes to collaboration and discussions. As
said before, it is very easy to end up focusing on your work and ignoring the rest of the world.
Join standups if you do them, make your team stream talks you are interested in,
join meetings, discussions, etc.

Here a capture of my team on a standup using [appear.in](https://appear.in/) while I was working from Barcelona, Sofia
was working from Ã–stersund, and the rest of the team in the Stockholm office. You can tell it's a Friday, huh? Happy faces, empty desks... :smile:

3. **Be remote ready, always**: Be always ready to _welcome_ remote workers into
discussions and meeting. Be always ready to _join_ discussions and meetings. Set
up properly equipped conference rooms prior to the meetings in the office, be on
a quiet place where you can listen and talk, etc. You know the drill :wink:

#### Conclusion
As you can see, all these tips focus around the idea of collaboration on both sides.
It's all about inclusion and will :smile:.

I thing remote work is _good_ and at least for me, _necessary_ from time to time.
It is a nice way to change routine, take a break from monotonous life, see your
friends and family if you are working abroad, conciliate family with work, etc.

I hope you find this useful or at least slightly interesting :joy: If you do, share!
Opinions, experiences? would love to discuss them with you, write a comment!
