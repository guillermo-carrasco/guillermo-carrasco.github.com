This is a blog post about how and why I've migrated my blog from WordPress to a
Jekyll-based blog using GitHub for hosting. Let's start with the most FAQ, _why?_

#Why?

### Inspiration
people I admire/inspiring me doing it

### Convenience
Write offline, run locally...

### Too much money
WordPress is free, but I paied my domain and then I had to pay more for WordPress
to allow me to use it...

# How?

# Create a skeleton with Jekyll

# Google analytics
One of the things that made me hesitate more about migrating was WordPress stats
page. The stats page in WordPress is so nice and gives you a very nice report on
your blog statistics like: Visitors, views, likes, countries, clicks, etc.

To get at least some basic stats about my blog, I just decided to go for Google
analytics, as it is free and easy to integrate.
