As a person who works in bioinformatics, one of the questions I get more often is the one that gives
title to this blog post. As simple as the question is, it is very difficult to answer to a person that
has never read about sequencing technologies. It usually involves going around a breief description
of the most comonly used sequencing technology, so that after that I can introduce the concept of short read,
sequencing error, read quality, etc.

I have been reading a book called [Bioinformatic Algorithms: An active learning approach][biobook], by
Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner. In this book, there is such a good and simple description of this process, that
I though I could use it to explain to everyone  how do we sequence genomes on a comprehensive way. So here
it goes, enjoy!
